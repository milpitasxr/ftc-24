# Robot driver code for FTC 2024 - Into the Deep
Milpitas Xtreme Robotics 27669


## Running Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/milpitasxr/ftc-24
```

Open the project in Android Studio, and sync the project with Gradle files.

Connect to the Control Hub through the REV Hardware Client, and you should be able to build & upload the code to the robot.

**Note:** newer versions of Android studio use Java 21 by default, but this project requres Java 17.
- To fix this, go to Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle, then download a new Gradle JDK for Java 17. Save your changes and retry the Gradle project sync.
